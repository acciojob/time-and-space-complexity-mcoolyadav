    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is when scaling up the input size.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to the input size. Efficient algorithms strive to minimize this complexity. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <i>O(n)</i> grows linearly with the size of the input.
